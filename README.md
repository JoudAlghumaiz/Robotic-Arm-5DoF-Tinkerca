# 5 DoF Robotic Arm - TinkerCAD Design

## Project Overview

This repository contains the design files for a 5 Degrees of Freedom (5 DoF) articulated robotic arm, created using TinkerCAD. This project aims to provide a simple, yet functional, robotic arm model for educational purposes, 3D printing, or as a foundation for more complex robotics projects.

## Components

The robotic arm consists of the following main parts, each representing a joint or movable segment:

1.  **Base:** The fixed foundation, providing the first DoF (rotation).
2.  **Lower Arm:** Connects to the base, offering shoulder pitch.
3.  **Upper Arm:** Connects to the lower arm (elbow), providing elbow pitch.
4.  **Wrist:** Composed of two parts for pitch and roll movements.
5.  **Gripper/End Effector:** The final part designed for grasping objects.
